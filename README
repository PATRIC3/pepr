PEPR - Phylogenomic Estimation with Progressive Refinement

PEPR uses several third-party tools, which are included with this distribution for the 
convenience of the end user. PEPR has been tested with these specific versions of these
tools. Other versions may be substituted, but there is no guarantee that PEPR will work
properly with different versions. It is our best understanding that all of these
programs are available under terms that allow them to be distributed in this manner.
This document lists the third-party programs included, and the reasons we believe it is
acceptable for them to be redistributed in this fashion. With the exception of
FastTree, all third-party tools are unaltered. FastTree was modified, with assistance
from its author, Morgan Price, in order to use the WAG likelihood matrix, rather than
the default JTT matrix.
