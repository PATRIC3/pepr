PEPR - Phylogenomic Estimation with Progressive Refinement

Examples

Two example data sets are provided in the examples/ directory. These are to verify 
that your installation is working, and to provide example commands you can modify 
to begin building your own trees. 

To run the Erysipelotrichales example, run the following commands from the 'pepr'
directory containing this README document:

cd examples/
mkdir run_erysipelotrichales
cd run_erysipelotrichales/
sh ../../dist/pepr/scripts/pepr.sh -run_name erysipelotrichales -genome_file ../Erysipelotrichales/*faa -outgroup
../Erysipelotrichales/outgroup/*faa -outgroup_count 2 > erysipelotrichales.out

The Erysipelotrichales example should produce a tree with 100% support for all branches on the first round.


To run the Aquificales example, run the following commands:

cd examples/
mkdir run_aquificales
cd run_aquificales/
sh ../../dist/pepr/scripts/pepr.sh -run_name aquificales -genome_file ../Aquificales/*faa -outgroup
../Aquificales/outgroup/*faa -outgroup_count 2 > aquificales.out

The Aquificales example should build a full tree then do one refinement round. The resulting 
tree should have all 100% branch supports, except one branch with ~40%.


PEPR uses several third-party tools, which are included with this distribution for the 
convenience of the end user. PEPR has been tested with these specific versions of these
tools. Other versions may be substituted, but there is no guarantee that PEPR will work
properly with different versions. It is our best understanding that all of these
programs are available under terms that allow them to be distributed in this manner.
This document lists the third-party programs included, and the reasons we believe it is
acceptable for them to be redistributed in this fashion. With the exception of
FastTree, all third-party tools are unaltered. FastTree was modified, with assistance
from its author, Morgan Price, in order to use the WAG likelihood matrix, rather than
the default JTT matrix.

Note that blat is only available for "personal, academic, and non-profit use". If your 
use does not fit this description, you must use the blast option, rather than the blat 
option.

Running PEPR on the included example data set (Alphaproteobacteria):
        Retrieve the tarfile at dist/pepr.tar. Unpack the tar with
        tar -xf pepr.tar
        This will create a directory, 'pepr'.
        Create a directory to run the example, and cd to the directory. (This is optional and recommended due to the files generated.)
        Start the pipeline by running the script at pepr/scripts/build_alpha_tree.sh
